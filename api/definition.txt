PUB/SUB - event driven architecture
    publisher and subscriber design pattern which we used for real time updates, communication between multiple component in microservice architechture , without knowing each other or having any direct connection

    *like in radio station the publisher is the radio station and the subscribers are the users* 
    *fire and forget is like if we have a show at 9pm and 2 subscribers are there and if a subscriber comes at 9:15pm then he will not get the show*
    *communication is one way from publisher to subscriber*








    Monolith : running server is only one but all components are tightly coupled and run within the same process
        cons : scaling is difficult (cannot scale a particular component)
               





    Microservices




    SingleTon pattern: LOW LEVEL DESIGN
    it is used when we want only one object of a class to be created 
    if a resource is shared between multiple components then we want one person to control that resource
    (we want only one instance of the class)



example: we have an ecommerce website open in 3 tabs and if we do add to cart in one tab and it will be done in all three tabs
how??
